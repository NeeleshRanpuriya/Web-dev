    <h1>Iron man</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <a href="www.google.com">Iron Man </a>is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.</p>

    <h2>Publication History</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Premier</h3>
    <p>Iron Man was one of several characters whom Marvel gave a full-length dedicated series in 1968.[24] Marvel combined the final issues of Tales of Suspense and the Sub-Mariner's Tales to Astonish into a one-shot special, Iron Man and Sub-Mariner.[25] Iron Man then began its run under writer Archie Goodwin.[26] Goodwin reintroduced political themes slowly over the following years, with a focus on domestic issues like racial conflict and environmentalism rather than geopolitics.[27] George Tuska started illustrating the character in Iron Man #5 (1968) and intermittently served as artist for much of the 1970s.[28][29] In total, he drew over one hundred issues for the character.[30]</p>
    <h3>Solo Series</h3>
    <p>The Iron Man series reverted to the original numbering in 2011, when the overall 500th issue was published as Iron Man #500.[59] A concurrent series, Iron Man Legacy by Fred Van Lente, was launched in 2010 leading up to the release of the film Iron Man 2.[76] Iron Man was then one of several characters whose series was relaunched at issue #1 with the Marvel Now! branding following the 2012 Avengers vs. X-Men event,[77] written by Kieron Gillen.[78] The 2014 "AXIS" event led into the Superior Iron Man series by Tom Taylor, featuring Iron Man with a new reversed personality.[79]</p>

    <h2>Frictional Character biography</h2><hr>
    <p>Iron Man stories contrast the armor's strength and the vulnerability of the human inside it.[169][165] The armor protects Iron Man externally from attacks, but it also protected him internally when it kept his heart beating.[166] The form-fitting design of many Iron Man armors emphasizes this with a human figure in an otherwise robotic-looking character.[132]</p>
